  		<p>
  			Barber surgeons used to perform surgeries in medieval Europe- often helping to treat people injured by the war.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Promotion in the field of barber surgery came from apprenticeship, not academia. Many of these practitioners were illiterate.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			Tasks include bloodletting, removing teeth, performing enemas and small-scale surgery as well as cutting hair.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			The symbol of the modern barber pole comes from a bloody cloth wrapped around a cylinder.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			This object was placed outside of the barber shop to advertise that the barber inside could also perform surgery.

  		<p>
  			Barber pole technology revolves around the work of William "Bill" Marvy.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			He began working at a barber supply company in 1922 at the age of 13 years old.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			On New Year's Day in 1950, the Marvy family came up with our current image of the barber pole.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			William Marvy Company continues to make barber poles, specializing in products to clean them.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  			The company, located in St. Paul, Minnesota, has produced over 82,000 barber poles.
